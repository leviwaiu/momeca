## Momeca: Privately developed Discord Bot. ##

This is only a readme to comply with the github regulations.
The bot created above is momeca: it adds, deletes and then sends reaction images that are sent to other people in the chat.

This is only a brief introduction: If you want, you can improve this to include instructions as to how to run and to manage momeca.

#Acknowledgement

The original code is not written by me: it is written by two other users.
